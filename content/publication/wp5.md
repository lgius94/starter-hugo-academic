abstract: This paper investigates whether the growing geographical dispersion of teams creates frictions that vary by gender. It shows that female inventors are more collocated with their team than male inventors, and this gap increases with age, possibly due to family obligations.
summary: This study examines gender differences in team collocation among inventors, finding that female inventors are more geographically constrained, especially as they age.
