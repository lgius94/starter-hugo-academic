abstract: This study tests the role of confidentiality agreements in idea transactions using data from an online marketplace of digital startups. It finds that while NDAs increase information sharing, they discourage bidder participation and may not effectively foster idea markets.
summary: This paper evaluates the impact of NDAs on idea transactions, showing that they enhance information sharing but reduce bidder participation.
