abstract: How can innovators that hold “contrarian” perspectives commercialize their ideas? This paper tests the hypothesis that contrarians need to settle the controversy and convince skeptics before commercializing their ideas. Using data from AI competitions, the study shows that winners, especially contrarian ones, are more likely to establish startups.
summary: This paper tests how contrarians can commercialize their ideas using data from AI competitions, showing that public demonstrations are crucial for contrarian entrepreneurship.
